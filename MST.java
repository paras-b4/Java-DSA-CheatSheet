/*
 Minimum spaning tree :- A spanning tree is a subset of graph G(v,E) which has all vertices covered with min no of edge .

 properties of Spanning tree
 1. A spanning tree has (n-1) edges where n is vertices .
 2. IF graph is complete then there are n^n-2 spanning tree .
 3. No of Vertices and Edge are same in all Spanning tree .
 4. There are no cycle in spaning tree .
